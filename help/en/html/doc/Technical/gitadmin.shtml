      <h1>JMRI Code: GitHub Administration</h1>

      <h2>Background</h2>
      
      JMRI uses
      <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>
      to host our 
      <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI">main code repository</a>, 
      <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/releases">releases and downloads</a>
      and 
      <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/issues">issues lists</a>.
      It also hosts 
      <a href="https://github.com/JMRI">several related repositories</a>.
      
      <p>
      The rest of this page records how we configure and use GitHub,
      along with associated procedures.
      
      <p>
      Related info on other pages:
      <ul>
        <li><a href="ContinuousIntegration.shtml">Continuous Integration</a>
            - doesn't really talk about how GitHub is configured for this, now how the services
                are configured
        <li><a href="gitdeveloper.shtml">Labels on Issues/PRs</a>
      </ul>
      
      <h2>Merging a PR</h2>
      
      Should we write a few words about things to do before/during 
      merging a PR?  E.g.
      when to set the milestone, whether to set the submitter as an assignee.
      What to record when restarting after a CI error?
      When to (unilaterally) set WIP?
      How to handle reviews?  Etc.

      <h2>How we use "Teams"<h2>
      
      What each team does
      
      Terms for adding people to developer status
        Have to have a real name on their GitHub account?
        Have to subscribe (and stay subscribed) to jmri-developers?
        Have to have worked on something other than their own projects?
      
      <h2>Branches</h2>
      
      What do we keep as
      <a href="https://github.com/JMRI/JMRI/branches">main repository branches</a>
      (as opposed to in user repositories, which is not our problem)?
      When do we clean them out?
